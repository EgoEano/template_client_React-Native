PROJECT CREATION AND LAUNCH
0. AVD (for Android) must be installed and set up

WARNING!!! A shorter project path helps avoid Windows’ 260-character limit, which can break tools like CMake and Ninja during builds. Keeping your project closer to the drive root dramatically reduces these risks.

1. Go to the folder where you want to store the project (do not create the project folder yourself) and run the command below. npx will suggest installing any missing libraries and will create the project folder for you:
	npx @react-native-community/cli init <name> --version 0.82.1

2. To check requirements, use:
	npx react-native doctor

3. To run the project (on Android):
	npx react-native run-android

4. When the clean project runs without issues, copy the files from the template into the root of the project with replacement, and remove this files from project:
	App.tsx
	babel.config.js
	jest.config.js
	tsconfig.json
	index.js

5. Install new packages
	npm i
	
6. 
For dev server mode with web, build dev at first:
	_web_build_dev.bat
And after that you can use 
	_web_start_dev.bat
	
For Android mobile dev mode just use
	_mobile_android_start_dev.bat
	
For debug and production builds use
	_mobile_android_build_dev.bat
	_mobile_android_build_prod.bat

7. Done. The project is ready to use
